# ofxPonk

## Introduction

This openFrameworks addon allows to send a ofPolyline to MadMapper using Ponk, based on the specifications and code available at: https://github.com/madmappersoftware/Ponk.

## Installation
Install the plugin using git clone, or download the code directly

## Compatibility

* So far just tested with the current master branch in October 2022. oF Version >0.11.2.
* But there is no reason it should not work with earlier versions.

## Dependencies 

Some files are directly copied from https://github.com/madmappersoftware/Ponk. As at the time beeing the protokol is in it's very early stages, it might change soon.

## Roadmap

- this is a very simple first integration, possibly more abstractions will come as fx a simpler handlign of meta data
- ofPolyline is missing the ability to create multicolored lines, so possibly we need another datatype to handle that, suggestions are welcome.

## Version history

### Version 0.1 (10/2022):
Very simpel operational version.
